The Caesar cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting
the characters of a plaintext message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Your task
is to implement a Caesar cipher in C, where you will encrypt and decrypt messages based on a
given shift value.

Sample Input:
Enter shift value: 3
Enter the plaintext message: Hello World

Sample Output:
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog
Decrypted message: Hello World
